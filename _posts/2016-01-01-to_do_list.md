we use supercomputers to forecast the weather.  why not public policy?

if they can do it with the universe, surely we can do it with our country: [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v509/n7499/full/nature13316.html](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v509/n7499/full/nature13316.html)

make 100 difficult predictions.  e-mail them to reporters?  no action now: i will contact you in a year and remind you of this e-mail.

use PCA in the synthetic model?  has to be survey-weighted.
