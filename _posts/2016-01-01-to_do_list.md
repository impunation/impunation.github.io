we use supercomputers to forecast the weather.  why not public policy?

if they can do it with the universe, surely we can do it with our country: [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v509/n7499/full/nature13316.html](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v509/n7499/full/nature13316.html)

use PCA in the synthetic model?  has to be survey-weighted.

the world needs small area estimation of climate change.  "this is what will happen in my backyard"
