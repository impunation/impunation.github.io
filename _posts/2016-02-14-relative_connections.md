## notes

https://github.com/impunation/relative_connections

impute mother, father, aunt, uncle, brother, sister, grandmother, grandfather IDs?  EVEN outside the household.  impute blood, adoptive, step-relatives.

figure out how to impute family connections..this probably has to be done before imputing individuals--

impute the full family's structure, across housing units
